# MLDS_Final
Machine Learning and Having it Deep and Structure Final Project

## Introduction
This repository is a duplication of the final team project, Deep Learning MythBusters ([website](https://ntumlds.wordpress.com/)), of NTU Machine Learning and Having it Deep and Structure (MLDS) Course ([website](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses_MLDS17.html)) in Spring, 2017. This project is worked by Zong-Xing Lin, Chiu-Te Wang, Chao-Chung Wu, and Chih-Te Lai. Inspired by Lutz Prechelt's [work](https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/stop_tricks1997.pdf) which studied multiple early stopping rules in training feed-forward neural network, in this project, we conduct the efficiency of early stopping rules in training recurrent neural network.  For the completed results and source code, please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/Chiu-Te-Wang/MLDS_FINAL) and for the final report, please go to this [page](https://ntumlds.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/r05922007_ai%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E9%9A%9C/).
